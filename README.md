# jlg-geography
A library that facilitates the creation and manipulation of geographic information. Highlights of this API:
* implementation of cartesian coordinates
* implementation of wsg84 coordinates expressed as latitude and longitude
* projection of wsg84 to cartesian and vice versa
* implementeation of basic geometric shapes that can be used for geographic applications (line, multi-line, polygon, multi-polygon)
* extensibility
